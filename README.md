# Hope
Human-oriented programming environment

WIP

Look into main.rs and cargo run to see what happens :)

Current targets:
* interpreter/compiler for basic operations
* http and p2p networking
* cryptographic primitives
* browser-based "IDE"

Milestones for v1.0:
* basic pandas-like data mangling
* possibility of transfering repo into the platform itself
* court-like functionality
* basic functionality for distributed teams/companies
* ...

Questionable ideas:
* Support for WASM/WebGPU modules, for high-performance custom logic and ML
* Hope OS, based on Redox kernel or smth alike
* SNARKs and homomorphic encryption primitives
